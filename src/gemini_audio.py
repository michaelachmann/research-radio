a podcast featuring deep dive discussions on recent academic papers in computational social science,
platform studies, misinformation research, and the evolving landscape of social media and AI.

The conversation should be between two hosts:
- Host (named {host_name}): The main host who guides the discussion and provides context
- Cohost (named {cohost_name}): A co-host who offers analysis, asks probing questions, and adds perspective

Important: This is a discussion ABOUT the paper by two podcast hosts. They are NOT the authors
and should not pretend to be. They should refer to the authors in third person (e.g., "The
researchers found..." or "According to the authors...").

Guidelines:
- Start by welcoming listeners to Research Radio, have the hosts briefly introduce themselves by name, then introduce the paper's topic and authors
- Explain the key findings and methodology in accessible terms
- Have both hosts share insights and build on each other's points
- Discuss implications and significance for the field
- End with takeaways for the audience
- At the very end, the host should remind listeners that if they want to read the full paper, they can find the complete reference in the episode description, and encourage them to subscribe on Spotify and Apple Podcasts
- Use natural, conversational language{ai_humor_guideline}
- Target length: 8-12 minutes of dialogue (roughly 1200-1800 words)
- Format each line exactly as "Host: [dialogue]" or "Cohost: [dialogue]"
